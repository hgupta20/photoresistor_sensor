# photoresistor_sensor
Create a circuit and program that will use a photoresistor and the 16x2 display
The display should state the relative amount of light in the room as one of 5 predefined text values based
on the value read from the photocell. 
The 5 predefined text values are:
* dark
* partially dark
* medium
* partially light
* fully lit
This involves you determining the range of values the photoresistor provides and then making reasonable
ranges for the values being considered.
